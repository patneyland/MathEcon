This is the first system of differential equations covered in my Math Methods for Econ and Finance II class. It is an equation for 401(k) Asset Accumulation. 
$\frac{dk(t)}{dt} = rk(t) + sw(t)$ for $t \in [0,T]$
$\frac{dk(t)}{dt} = rk(t) - A$ for $t \in [T,\overline{T}]$
$k$ is the savings/financial(401k) account balance
$w$ is income
$s$ is savings rate
$r$ is interest rate

While this problem, with constant variables, can be solved analytically, this script seeks to solve it numerically to practice for more complex instances that cannot be solved analytically. 

```{r}
discrete_approx <- function()


q0 <- 1
q1 <- 0.0315
q2 <- -0.00062
r <- 0.035
w <- 50000
s <- 0.1
T <- 40
Tbar <- 55
k_Tbar <- 0
A_approx <- 
dt <- 0.01
```
